# JumpQuest

Second year Unreal AIV exam platform project. The objective of the game is to overcome 3 arenas.
- In the first arena you have to collect all the coins.
- In the second arena you have to defeat all the enemies.
- In the third arena you have to collect all the coins and defeat all the enemies.

To defeat an enemy you have to jump on his head. During the game you will find destructible crates that could drop an additional coin or a heart. If the player loses all 3 lives he will have to start over from the beginning.
